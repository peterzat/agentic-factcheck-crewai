â”‚  Inflation, the rate at which prices increase, has been rising at the        â”‚
â”‚  fastest pace for several years across many sectors, affecting consumers     â”‚
â”‚  worldwide. In the US, the cost of many goods has significantly increased    â”‚
â”‚  due to inflation, with notable changes in the prices of selected goods.     â”‚
â”‚  Globally, inflation is on the rise, with food and energy prices hitting     â”‚
â”‚  record highs. This increase is largely driven by pent-up consumer demand    â”‚
â”‚  following the easing of restrictions in many parts of the world.            â”‚
